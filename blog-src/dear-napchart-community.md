# The current state of Napchart

Dear Napchart-community,

For a few years now, Napchart has been up and running. It has gone through transformations and upgrades, including a few different takes of the user interface. Over 20000 charts have been saved and shared, and a bunch of people have visited the site every day.

I am the creator of Napchart. *I have blood on my hands*

Recently I rolled out a new version with a set of new features:

* **Pen mode** - allows you to create elements by clicking and dragging
* **Choose how many lanes**
* **More colors**
* ++ under-the-hood tm

Happy and relieved to be finished, I pushed the new version to the website. *Without noticing anyone, or showing it to anyone.* The new update was a big mistake.

Don't get me wrong. The new update was a real improvement. But I had forgotten some *essential* features from the previous version.

* The back button (history) was missing
* The lock button was missing

That's when I realized, I need a closer relationship with the users. I need to listen to the feedback and not *break things*. Let's build this tool together, lets face the hard problems and make the best version of Napchart possible. *For everyone*

## The way forward

The first thing we need to do is make a better *feedback and communications system*. Right now, with the feedback form, all feedback is sent right to me. And that's great, but I think it would have been better if the feedback could have been read by *everyone*. Let all of us discuss and share experiences. What works? What doesn't work? This way, we would have better understanding of what is important, and what needs to be done to preserve functionality and user experience.

I am not sure exactly how to do this, but it may or may not include user registration on napchart.com. What is your opinion on this? Would it work to make a small communication hub/forum/list?

So far (just a few days) this is some of the feedback submitted:

* The lock button
* The history back button
* 24 hours / 12 hours (am/pm)
* More lanes than 4?
* Difficult to read chart (darker lines)
* Sidebar is misbehaving
* Difficult to use on mobile/small screens

## How can I contribute

If you are interested in programming, web or javascript, you can contribute directly on GitHub. If you have and idea or an issue, I would love to help you and mentor you to do that yourself.

For non-programmers (most of you I guess) you can still contribute by sending feedback and providing issues and ideas.

* How can Napchart be better?
* How can more people get use of Napchart?
